... so does any of this actually work?

I learned about Catch2 ... you just need to include `#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN` in the header, put your tests in their own directory, then you can run them on their own.

In CMakeLists.txt you just need to

### 1. find_package

This tells CMake to look for Catch2 on your system (via CMake's module system).

### 2. enable_testing()

### 3. add_executable

add_executable(test_gameOver tests/test_gameOver.cpp ...)
add_executable(test_move_validator tests/test_move_validator.cpp ...)

### 4. target_link_libraries()

This line links your test executables against Catch2, so you get access to all the Catch2 macros (like TEST_CASE, REQUIRE, etc.).

### 5. add_test

Finally this allows you to run the tests all at once with `ctest` or else manually like this `test_gameOver`

My CMakeLists.txt became:

```bash
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(chess_bot)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
find_package(Catch2 REQUIRED)

include_directories(include
                    external)

add_executable(chess_bot
    main.cpp
    src/board.cpp
    src/piece.cpp
    src/move_validator.cpp
    src/game_manager.cpp
)


# Executable for test_gameOver
add_executable(test_gameOver
    tests/test_gameOver.cpp
    src/board.cpp
    src/piece.cpp
    src/move_validator.cpp
    src/game_manager.cpp
)

# Executable for test_move_validator
add_executable(test_move_validator
    tests/test_move_validator.cpp
    src/board.cpp
    src/piece.cpp
    src/move_validator.cpp
    src/game_manager.cpp
)

enable_testing()

# Link and register tests
target_link_libraries(test_gameOver Catch2::Catch2)
add_test(NAME GameOverTest COMMAND test_gameOver)

target_link_libraries(test_move_validator Catch2::Catch2)
add_test(NAME MoveValidatorTest COMMAND test_move_validator)
```

Then I can begin to write the unit tests. A basic test looks like this:

```cpp
TEST_CASE("Pawn can move two squares from starting position", "[pawn]") {
    Board board;
    MoveResult result = MoveValidator::isvalidMove(board, "e4", "white");
    REQUIRE(result.valid == true);
}
```

I had to think of the range of things that tested - "minimal but complete" as they say.

This led me to test one canonical legal move and one canonical illegal move for each major concept: - Each piece type (pawn, knight, rook, bishop, queen, king) - Special moves (castling, en passant, pawn promotion) - Rule enforcement (check, self-check, invalid notation)

Here's what I came up with so far.

**Basic legality**
TEST_CASE("Basic Pawn Move") ensures that standard opening moves work.

**Illegal vs. legal movement**
Ne5 fails (wrong square), Nf3 passes ‚Äî this confirms knight move logic is working as expected.

**Sliding piece logic**
For rooks and bishops, I checked that they can‚Äôt ‚Äúphase‚Äù through other pieces. If Rh3 is blocked, it fails; after clearing the path, it passes.

**Castling**
Separate tests ensure: - Valid king-side and queen-side castling pass when legal - Castling fails if any required condition is violated (e.g., king moved, path not clear, in check)

**Self-check rules**
Moves that leave the king in check are invalid. These are tested with simulated attacks and forced king escapes.

**Historical rules**
Scholars Mate is included as a real-game sequence test ‚Äî testing both correctness and sanity of the move validator when chaining moves.

## Lessons Learned

### Duplicate SAN Parsing

I realized, thanks to many many print statements, that parseSAN was being called multiple times over. I refactored to parse the move once, then pass the parsed move into both steps. SAN notation is weird in that, it doesn't give outrightly any info about the departure square - you just have to scan around looking for pieces that _could_ reach the target square. That's where our `pieceCanReach` from before gets called.

### Better Errors

Instead of `isvalidMove` returning bool, I upgraded it to reutn a custom struct `MoveResult` so I can more cleanly capture the reason a move failed. In theory, this ensures that unit tests are passing/failing for the reasons they should.
