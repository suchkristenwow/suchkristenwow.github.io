<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Thanks for visiting my website. I'm a roboticist with a background in long-term SLAM and perception for precision agriculture. I recently completed my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I was part of the Autonomous Robotics and Perception Group. Before that, I earned a B.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics from the University of Chicago.

My research focuses on developing autonomous systems that can operate reliably in complex, real-world environments. I see robots as tools to address large-scale, high-stakes challenges — whether that’s restoring degraded ecosystems or improving decision-making in uncertain conditions.

The bulk of my dissertation centered on **Restorebot**, an autonomous robotic platform for **revegetating degraded rangelands**. These ecosystems cover roughly 40% of the Earth's surface and support 38% of the global population[^1], yet nearly 20% are currently degraded due to climate change and land mismanagement[^2]. My work combines SLAM, multi-agent coordination, and computer vision to help make ecological restoration scalable and sustainable.

### Watch Restorebot in Action
