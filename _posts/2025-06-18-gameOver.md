Next I figured I'd work on checking if there was a winner or a stalemate. This function would be called by the gameManager.

How do you win at Chess? You win if

1. The opponent is in Check _and_
2. The opponent has no moves which could get them out of Check

There is an alternative outcome is a stalemate. This is when

1. The opponent is not in Check _and_
2. The opponent has no legal moves

This led me to writing `getAllLegalMoves` which checks all the available legal moves for a given color. This is important not just to check for game-ending/stalemate conditions, but also later on when the computer will have to choose its next move (presumably from a list of legal moves or else make sure that it's desired move is in the list of legal possibilities).

This function got complicated quickly. Initially, I wrote everything under one massive function until I got to the Queen part and I remembered from the move validator implementation that a Queen is just a rook and a bishop standing on top of each other under a trench coat, so it really behooves you to write smaller sub functions e.g `getAllRookMoves` (not to mention it's probably better for debugging/testing).

Then, the function iterates over the board and finds the available moves for each piece still on the board. I thought this was preferable to the alternative, the dreaded quadruple for-loop (2 loops to iterate over the board, plus 2 more nested loops to simulate every move moving to each destination square using `pieceCanReach`).

### FEN Parsing

Rather than start from the standard 8x8 starting position, I realized I needed an empty board that I could stage tests like the Analysis board on chess.com

So I added a method to my `Board` class to clear everything and allow me to place individual pieces manually

The way this is typically done is called FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) strings, which is a very compact notation that captures the state of a chess board at a given instance.

What is FEN? It's made of 6 space-separated fields

#### 1. Piece Placement

This is a '/' separated list of 8 ranks where white is capitalized and black is lowercase.

#### 2. Active Color

#### 3. Castling availability

#### 4. En passant target square

This is '-' if none.

#### 5. Halfmove clock

For the 50 move rule

#### 6. Fullmove number

Again, some matches have a maximum number of moves so this tracks that

Using input streams, I can extract the location, color, and name of each piece on the board. This is what it looks like:

```cpp
iss >> piecePlacement >> activeColor >> castling >> enPassant >> halfmoveClock >> fullmoveNumber;
```

Then I iterate over the piecePlacement and init the corresponding piece where it's meant to be.

This is what the function became:

```cpp
std::string Board::loadFEN(const std::string& fen){
    clearBoard();  // Reset grid to empty

    std::istringstream iss(fen);
    std::string piecePlacement, activeColor, castling, enPassant;
    int halfmoveClock, fullmoveNumber;

    iss >> piecePlacement >> activeColor >> castling >> enPassant >> halfmoveClock >> fullmoveNumber;

    int row = 0, col = 0;
    for (char c : piecePlacement) {
        std::string color = isupper(c) ? "white" : "black";
        if (c == '/') {
            row++;
            col = 0;
        } else if (isdigit(c)) {
            col += c - '0';
        } else {
            std::string name;
            switch (tolower(c)) {
                case 'p': name = "pawn"; break;
                case 'n': name = "knight"; break;
                case 'b': name = "bishop"; break;
                case 'r': name = "rook"; break;
                case 'q': name = "queen"; break;
                case 'k': name = "king"; break;
            }
            std::string displayName;
            int point_val;
            if (color == "white"){
                if (name == "pawn"){displayName = "w_P"; point_val = 1;}
                if (name == "knight"){displayName = "w_N"; point_val = 3;}
                if (name == "bishop"){displayName = "w_B"; point_val = 3;}
                if (name == "rook"){displayName = "w_R"; point_val = 5;}
                if (name == "queen"){displayName = "w_Q"; point_val = 9;}
                if (name == "king"){displayName = "w_K"; point_val = 1000;}
            } else {
                if (name == "pawn"){displayName = "b_P"; point_val = 1;}
                if (name == "knight"){displayName = "b_N"; point_val = 3;}
                if (name == "bishop"){displayName = "b_B"; point_val = 3;}
                if (name == "rook"){displayName = "b_R"; point_val = 5;}
                if (name == "queen"){displayName = "b_Q"; point_val = 9;}
                if (name == "king"){displayName = "b_K"; point_val = 1000;}
            }
            char file = 'a' + col;
            int rank = 8 - row;
            bool hasMoved = check_hasMoved(name, color, row, col, castling);
            auto piece = std::make_shared<Piece>(name, color, displayName, file, rank, point_val);
            piece->hasMoved = hasMoved;

            grid[row][col] = piece;
            col++;

            if (col > 8 || row > 7) {
                throw std::runtime_error("FEN parsing error: exceeded board bounds.");
            }
        }
    }
    std::cout << "Done loading FEN this is the board ... " << std::endl;
    printBoard();
    std::string turn = (activeColor == "w") ? "white" : "black";
    return turn;
}
```

I've written the unit tests and it passes, but I'm not fully convinced ... next I think I want to work on writing the infrastructure for loading in games from available databases and make sure that the moveValidator and checkGameOver are working. I'll need this either way when I start implementing the part where the computer starts making decisions.
